What is fashion?

Fashion is a simple library for Compojure web application developers,
which allows you to write your CSS in the same language as the rest of
your app. You write your stylesheet in Clojure and fashion generates
concise, readable CSS.

Fashion was largely inspired by the popular stylesheet preprocessor
Sass (http://sass-lang.com/).
